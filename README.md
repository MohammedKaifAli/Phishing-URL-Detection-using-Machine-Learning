# 🛡️ Phishing URL Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning web application that detects whether a given URL is **legitimate** or **phishing** based on its features.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project uses a trained ML model to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate. It leverages **TF-IDF vectorization** and **machine learning algorithms** such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest for classification.

The web interface is built with **Flask** and allows users to input a URL and instantly check its safety.
